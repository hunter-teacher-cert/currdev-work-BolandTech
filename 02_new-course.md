## Data Science in Action

### General description:  

This would be a semester long course that focuses on introducing students from all backgrounds to Data Science.  The focus of the course would be taking students through the process of gathering and analyzing data; identifying patterns, trends, and relationships in data sets; making inferences and drawing conclusions based of what they observe in the data; and considering any ethical dilemmas that may arise.  

Students will be expected to form their own questions about the world around them, analyze data using multiple methods, and write a research paper about their findings. The course will cover functions, looping and iteration, data visualization, and linear regression, to name a few Computer Science concepts. The overall content of the course will involve social studies, science, and business concepts which will help students make inferences from data. Students will also be introduced to foundational mathematical concepts in statistics.

## Target audience: 

High school students from all backgrounds and Computer Science exposure.


## Course Fit

My schoolwide focus is to incorporate research in all content areas.  This course could serve to support that goal.  Students would learn how to use data to support or refute arguments, which can easily translate across contents.
