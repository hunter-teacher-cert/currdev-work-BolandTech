### What is the language?

JavaScript

### What is the course? (grade level, student experience)

The course that I would be using JavaScript with is a beginner Web Design Course open to all grade levels, and students with varied levels of experience.


### How does one write & run code in this language?

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom. This means that you need to be careful what order you put things in.

### Rate the complexity of the syntax?

- JavaScript syntax is the set of rules for how JavaScript programs are constructed.

- JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
  - Fixed values called Literals.
    - The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:
      1. Numbers are written with or without decimals: 
      2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
  - Variable values called Variables.
 
  - In a programming language, variables are used to store data values. JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables. An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

Once you get the basics of JavaScript down, it can be pretty straight forward; however, it can be a little tricky if you forget any keywords, rules for operators, or specific identifiers.

Strengths
---
### How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?

I would do a pair-programming format to utilize strengths of students that seem to pick up on the syntax quickly.


Weaknesses
---
### How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?

As a way to mitigate weaknesses, I would be sure to incorporate code-a-longs.


### Why did you select this language for this class?

I selected this language because I think it isn't too dificult for a beginner coder to learn.
