# Task: Modeling Periodic Phenomena

## Overview								             	 

What do Ferris Wheels, sound waves, hours of daylight, moon phases, and tides all have in common? All of these phenomena can be modeled with mathematics and represent natural periodic patterns.

As humans, we witness periodic phenomena in our everyday lives. We all notice that the sun rises and falls, the existence of seasons, and the cycles of weather and rush hour traffic. Periodic functions exist all around us and they can help us predict outcomes in the future. This project will require you to use your knowledge of graphing/interpreting trigonometric functions to identify and interpret a natural periodic phenomenon. Creating models of these phenomena help make sense of what we are seeing.


## Phase 1: Investigating Circular Motion 

You will explore how a Ferris Wheel fits into the periodic function realm through using multiple representations not limited to diagrams, tables, and graphs. In doing so you will begin to see the relationships among all the Ferris Wheelâ€™s components. The knowledge gained from this introduction will be based on evidence that will help you anticipate and predict the potential opportunities and limitations of such a model. 

For phase 1 of your performance task, you will explore how the properties of periodic functions can help you understand the functioning of  a Ferris wheel. 

1. As a class, we investigate the heights of various Ferris Wheel cars off the ground.
2. With a partner, graph the heights over time and develop a function that models these heights so we could find the height of a car at any given time.
3.  As a class, we explore the situation of the Ferris wheel with a diagram, table, and graph and make sense of the data by formulating conclusions.


## Phase 2: Investigating Another Periodic Phenomenon 

You will propose a periodic phenomenon in our natural world to research and model.
Use your knowledge of trigonometric functions from Phase 1 to graph your periodic phenomenon and explain its various parts. 

For phase 2 of your performance task, you will demonstrate your ability to make sense of data, model in various ways, and make multiple connections based on evidence.  You will submit a proposal of a mathematical model that represents your selected periodic phenomenon.

Your proposal must include:
- An explanation of the phenomenon that you chose to research (what is it, where does it  occur, how is it measured?)
- The maximum and minimum values (should be based off of data)
- How long it takes the cycle to repeat itself
- How you know the phenomenon is periodic
- Anything you find interesting about the phenomenon


## Phase 3: Final Performance Task Submission

For the final submission you will make a multimedia presentation explaining your phenomenon and its model, including its significance and limitations.  

For your final task, create a depiction of the phenomenon from Phase 2, a graph of it, and a function that models it.

Your final submission must include:

- A PowerPoint or write-up detailing the periodic phenomenon that you investigated accompanied with a 5-6min oral presentation.
  - Introductory paragraph must be included (Refer to Phase 2)

- Provide the key points for your periodic function. Key points must include all of the following:
  - A graph that models your periodic phenomenon
  - Independent and dependent variables
  - Period of the situation and what that means in your situation
  - Midline of the situation and what context
  -	Amplitude and what this means in your situation
  -	A graph of the function. If your situation has data points, include a scatterplot of points with the function       graphed over it. Ideally, this will be completed on desmos.com or another computer graphing utility.  The axes should be clearly labeled and scaled on a scale that makes sense.

- Summarize your findings. You must address the following questions:
  - Why is it important to be able to model your phenomenon with an equation and a graph?  Why might someone use it?
  - Is your model perfect?  If not, what are some limitations?  Is there any way to reduce the limitations?
  - Are you confident that your model would work far out into the future?  Forever?  If not, why not?
  - How and why is your model useful?
