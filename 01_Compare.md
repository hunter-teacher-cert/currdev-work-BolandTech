## Directions: Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).

### Currently Taugtht course: PLTW Cybersecurity

### Comparison Course: CodeHS Fundamentals of Cybersecurity


 #### Major differences:
 
 ##### PLTW
  - Uses a virtual environment
 
 
 ##### CodeHS
  - utilizes a blended classroom approach
  - content is a mix of web-based and physical activities
  - Students will modify existing code and run it in the browser, investigate cyber related topics and reflect on them and discuss them, create digital presentations, and engage in in-person collaborative exercises with classmates
  - Programming Environment:
    -  Students modify and run programs in the browser using the CodeHS online editor
    -  Students will be able to modify text-based programs in HTML, JavaScript, SQL and simulate shell commands.
    -  Students will also participate in simulated cyber attacks on safe sites in order to learn how to mitigate cyber attacks.
    -  Students will be able to document their processes and discuss best practices for preventing cyber attacks.
 
 
 #### Major similiarities:
 
 ##### PLTW
  
 
 
 ##### CodeHS
 
 
 
 
 #### Comparative strengths & weaknesses:  (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem equally good then no need to comment).
 
 ##### PLTW
  
 
 
 ##### CodeHS
 
 
 
 #### Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
