## Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).

### Currently Taugtht Course: PLTW Cybersecurity

### Comparison Course: CodeHS Fundamentals of Cybersecurity


 #### Major differences:
 
 ##### PLTW
  - problem-based learning, where students role-play and train as cybersecurity experts.
  - strongly connects to the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (also known as the NICE Framework or NCWF).
  - objectives also incorporate many of the big ideas and learning objectives outlined by the College Board and addressed in AP CSP and AP CSA
  - gives students a broad exposure to the many aspects of digital and information security, while encouraging socially responsible choices and ethical behavior. It inspires algorithmic thinking, computational thinking, and especially, “outside-the-box” thinking.
  - Students explore the many educational and career paths available to cybersecurity experts, as well as other careers that comprise the field of information security.

 ##### CodeHS
  - utilizes a blended classroom approach
  - content is a mix of web-based and physical activities
  - Students will modify existing code and run it in the browser, investigate cyber related topics and reflect on them and discuss them, create digital presentations, and engage in in-person collaborative exercises with classmates
  - students will learn basic SQL and JavaScript, and will utilize basic HTML and JavaScript within specific contexts
while being provided with support within those contexts.

  - Programming Environment:
    -  Students modify and run programs in the browser using the CodeHS online editor
    -  Students will be able to modify text-based programs in HTML, JavaScript, SQL and simulate shell commands.
    -  Students will also participate in simulated cyber attacks on safe sites in order to learn how to mitigate cyber attacks.
    -  Students will be able to document their processes and discuss best practices for preventing cyber attacks.
 
 
 #### Major similiarities: Both PLTW & CodeHS curricula cover the similar topics in varied fashion.

 - Module 10: IT Infrastructure (2-3 weeks/10-15 hours)
 - Module 11: Project: Troubleshooting Project (1 week/5 hours)

 #### Both curricula seem equally good and are both year-long corses. the approach in covering the topics are just different/varied for each.
 
 
 #### Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
 
 I would like to incorporate the programming environment component included with the codeHS curriculum.  While I like the problem-based learning focus of PLTW, I think the codeHS does a good job of incorporating some coding along with projects.
