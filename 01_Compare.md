## Directions: Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).

### Currently Taugtht course: PLTW Cybersecurity

### Comparison Course: CodeHS Fundamentals of Cybersecurity

 #### Major differences:
 
 ##### PLTW
  - problem-based learning, where students role-play and train as cybersecurity experts.
  - strongly connects to the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (also known as the NICE Framework or NCWF).
  - objectives also incorporate many of the big ideas and learning objectives outlined by the College Board and addressed in AP CSP and AP CSA
  - gives students a broad exposure to the many aspects of digital and information security, while encouraging socially responsible choices and ethical behavior. It inspires algorithmic thinking, computational thinking, and especially, “outside-the-box” thinking.
  - Students explore the many educational and career paths available to cybersecurity experts, as well as other careers that comprise the field of information security.

 
 ##### CodeHS
  - utilizes a blended classroom approach
  - content is a mix of web-based and physical activities
  - Students will modify existing code and run it in the browser, investigate cyber related topics and reflect on them and discuss them, create digital presentations, and engage in in-person collaborative exercises with classmates
  - Programming Environment:
    -  Students modify and run programs in the browser using the CodeHS online editor
    -  Students will be able to modify text-based programs in HTML, JavaScript, SQL and simulate shell commands.
    -  Students will also participate in simulated cyber attacks on safe sites in order to learn how to mitigate cyber attacks.
    -  Students will be able to document their processes and discuss best practices for preventing cyber attacks.
 
 
 #### Major similiarities:
 
 ##### PLTW

- Topics Covered:
 - Personal Security 
 - System Security 
 - Network Security 
 - Applied Cybersecurity
 
 ##### CodeHS
 
 - Topics Covered:
  - Personal Security 
  - System Security 
  - Network Security 
  - Applied Cybersecurity
 
 
 #### Comparative strengths & weaknesses:  (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem equally good then no need to comment).
 
 ##### PLTW
  
 
 
 ##### CodeHS
 
 
 
 #### Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
