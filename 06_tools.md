# P5 Web Editor

- What its general purpose is.

I use this tool for my art and animation unit.  


- The class(es) you use it in.

I use this with my 9th and 12th grade grade classes for creative coding units.


- How you use it in class.

This is the main tool students use to work on and save their projects.  


- Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?

I like to use P5 for creative coding because of the fact that their is a bank of built in functions that can be used...this levels the playing field for students that have little or no previous coding exposure.



# Pyret (code.pyret.org)

 I like to use pyret for Data Science because it allows students to easily use contracts they learn during the inro to coding unit when they first use pyret.  Pyret also allows for easy creation of displays to represent tables of data students collect themselves.
